## Build With

**MERN** is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

- [**R**eact](https://reactjs.org) / [**R**edux](https://redux.js.org) : Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- [**E**xpress](http://expressjs.com/) : Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) : JavaScript runtime environment â€“ lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
- [**M**ongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) : Document database â€“ used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents

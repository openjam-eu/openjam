      "**Pink Floyd** were an English [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music 'Rock music') band formed in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London 'London') in 1965. They achieved international acclaim with their [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock 'Progressive rock') and [psychedelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock 'Psychedelic rock') music. Distinguished by their philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions, and elaborate [live shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_live_performances 'Pink Floyd live performances'), they are one of the [most commercially successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists 'List of best-selling music artists') and influential groups in popular music history.",
      "Pink Floyd were founded by students [Syd Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett 'Syd Barrett') on guitar and lead vocals, [Nick Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason 'Nick Mason') on drums, [Roger Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters 'Roger Waters') on bass and vocals, and [Richard Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician) 'Richard Wright (musician)') on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, *[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piper_at_the_Gates_of_Dawn 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn')* (1967). Guitarist and vocalist [David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour 'David Gilmour') joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating [mental health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health 'Mental health'). Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album 'Concept album') behind their albums *[The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon 'The Dark Side of the Moon')* (1973), *[Wish You Were Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album) 'Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)')* (1975), *[Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_(Pink_Floyd_album) 'Animals (Pink Floyd album)')* (1977), *[The Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall 'The Wall')* (1979) and *[The Final Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cut_(album) 'The Final Cut (album)')* (1983). *The Dark Side of the Moon* and *The Wall* became two of the [best-selling albums of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums 'List of best-selling albums').",
      "Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, band member. The three produced two more albums—*[A Momentary Lapse of Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason')* (1987) and *[The Division Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Division_Bell 'The Division Bell')* (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of enmity, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London as part of the global awareness event [Live 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_8 'Live 8'); Gilmour and Waters stated they had no further plans to reunite the band. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, *[The Endless River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Endless_River 'The Endless River')* (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material.",
      "Pink Floyd were inducted into the American [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame 'Rock and Roll Hall of Fame') in 1996 and the [UK Music Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame 'UK Music Hall of Fame') in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide."
